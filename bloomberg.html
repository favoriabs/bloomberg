                        Norfolk Southern Tops CSX Bid for Conrail With US$100-Share Offer

                    <p>
                        Norfolk Southern Corp. offered Conrail Inc. shareholders $100 a share in cash, or $9 billion, 
                        topping rival CSX Corp.'s $7.8 billion agreement to buy the freight rail company for a combination 
                        of cash and stock. Based on Tuesday's closing price for CSX <br/> stock, Norfolk Southern's offer is 13 
                        percent higher than CSX's offer, which consists of 40 percent cash and 60 percent CSX stock. 
                        The winning bidder will become the dominant freight line on the East Coast.
